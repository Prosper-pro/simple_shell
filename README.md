This is a simple Unix shell implemented in __C__.

## How To Use

Run the command below to build the shell.

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o rash
```

Then run `$ ./rash` to startup the shell in interactive mode. To start the shell in non-interactive mode, run `$ ./rash file`, where `file` is a text-encoded file containing a list of commands to be executed.
